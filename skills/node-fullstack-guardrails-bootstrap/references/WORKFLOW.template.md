# Change workflow

For non-trivial changes. A typo or a one-line fix skips to step 5.

PLAN → IMPLEMENT → INDEPENDENT REVIEW → SECURITY/RISK REVIEW (when relevant)
→ TEST + RUNTIME PROOF → ARCHITECTURE CHECK (when structural) → OWNER BRIEF
→ RELEASE CHECK (when deploy-sensitive)

## 1. Plan

Do not edit yet.

- Trace the current behavior through the real execution path.
- Name the exact files and modules you will touch.
- Find the canonical existing operation, constant, pattern or component and reuse it.
- List writes and side effects (persistence, jobs, mail, events, external calls).
- Name the auth, authorization and tenant/account boundaries involved.
- State risks and how you will verify.
- Classify architecture impact: NONE / LOCAL / STRUCTURAL.

## 2. Implement

- Follow the plan; if reality contradicts it, update the plan first.
- Match repository conventions and neighboring code.
- Keep the diff scoped: no unrelated refactors or cleanup.
- Add or update tests; a bug fix gets a regression test when feasible.
- No casual dependencies; justify any new one.
- Preserve logs, metrics and error reporting; never log secrets or personal data.
- Comments: 1–2 lines of *why*. Longer reasons go to the project's long-why
  file (`HISTORY.md` or an existing equivalent) or `DECISIONS.md`,
  and the comment points to the anchor.
- Review your own final diff before calling it done.

## 3. Independent review

Fresh context when possible. Self-review does not count.

- Requirement vs implementation.
- Duplicated business logic or a second source of truth.
- Wrong auth/authorization assumptions, tenant or account leaks.
- Tests that mirror implementation instead of proving behavior.
- Unnecessary abstractions.
- Narrative comments, personal data, local paths or AI-tool metadata in the diff.
- The stack checks below.

Classify each finding BLOCKER / SHOULD FIX / OPTIONAL, with concrete evidence.
Do not return generic checklist noise.

## 4. Security / risk review

Only the attack surfaces the change touches: auth vs authorization, isolation,
input validation, injection (SQL, HTML, command, prompt), SSRF, redirects,
uploads, webhooks, secrets, rate limits, payments, dependency risk, plus the
stack checks below.

## 5. Test + runtime proof

Use the real commands from `TESTING.md`. Report each level separately:

1. builds / parses / typechecks
2. static checks and lint
3. unit and feature tests (which, how many passed)
4. the real path exercised (browser, process, worker, device) with evidence
5. integrations touched (queue, realtime, external API, payments)

Anything not verified is written as `UNVERIFIED`. A green build is not proof
that the feature works.

## 6. Architecture check

Compare against `AGENTS.md`, `GUARDRAILS_PROFILE.md`, `SYSTEM_MAP.md` and the
neighboring code. Look for a second implementation of one operation, a wrong
layer, new global state, hidden side effects, boundary drift and docs that
became false. Do not refactor for aesthetic purity.

## 7. Owner brief

For a technical owner who will not read the whole diff:

- **What changed**
- **Flow:** entry → operation → persistence/side effect → response
- **Files worth knowing:** at most 7
- **Risk:** LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
- **Proof:** exact checks and runtime verification done
- **Architecture:** NONE / LOCAL / STRUCTURAL
- **If it breaks:** where to look first, how to roll back
- **Human attention:** at most 3 things worth checking personally

## 8. Release check

Only for deploy-sensitive work. Review what applies: schema/data migrations,
environment variables, build output, workers and schedulers, caches, auth/IdP
config, webhooks, external services, feature flags, observability, rollback
sequence. Return GO / GO WITH CAUTION / NO-GO. Never GO on unit tests alone.

When something breaks in production: find the failing boundary, collect
evidence first, rank hypotheses, apply the safest mitigation, and fix
permanently only after the cause is proven.

## Stack checks — Node / TypeScript

- **Plan:** entry point (HTTP, CLI, worker, MCP tool, IPC) → module → state/persistence → side effects. Note which process runs the code and whether it must be restarted.
- **Implement:** follow the repo's native extension mechanism (adapters, providers, registries) instead of adding a parallel one; keep dependency direction; explicit failure modes, timeouts and retries.
- **Review:** circular or wrong-direction imports; god modules; runtime state leaking across requests or sessions; duplicated tool execution; stale async state; unsafe filesystem, command or network handling.
- **Security:** command injection; path traversal; SSRF; IPC/WebSocket/MCP boundaries; prompt or tool injection where model output drives side effects; resource exhaustion.
- **Runtime proof:** the running process actually loaded the new code; the changed path actually executed (request, command, tool call) with output as evidence.
- **Release:** process restarts and daemons; published package contents; config and env; data/schema migrations; backward compatibility for clients and plugins.
